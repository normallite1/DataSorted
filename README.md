 * The implementation of this method should sort dates.
     * The output should be in the following order:
     * Dates with an 'r' in the month,
     * sorted ascending (first to last),
     * then dates without an 'r' in the month,
     * sorted descending (last to first).
     * For example, October dates would come before May dates,
     * because October has an 'r' in it.
     * thus: (2005-07-01, 2005-01-02, 2005-01-01, 2005-05-03)
     * would sort to
     * (2005-01-01, 2005-01-02, 2005-07-01, 2005-05-03)
     *
     * @param unsortedDates - an unsorted list of dates
     * @return the collection of dates now sorted as per the spec
